## Summary of the analysis

In this brief report I have quantitatively analyzed the property and crop damage caused by the storm weather events, as well as the impact on the population health in the United States.

Subsequently, the data was aggregated according to the weather event type. For each event type, I computed the total economy damage ( property + crop), as well as count of injuries and fatalities, and segregated that over the states

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
